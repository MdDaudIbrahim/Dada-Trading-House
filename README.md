## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.).
*   (Optional but Recommended) A simple local web server to properly serve files, especially for testing features that might rely on server-like behavior (though this project is primarily client-side).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Dada-Trading-House.git
    ```
    Replace `yourusername` with the actual GitHub username or organization holding the repository.
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Dada-Trading-House
    ```

That's it! Since this is a static website, cloning the repository gives you all the necessary files.

### Running the Project

You can view the website in a couple of ways:

1.  **Directly Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
    ```bash
    # On most systems, this will open the file in your default browser
    open index.html
    # Or navigate to the file location in your browser's file explorer
    ```
    *Note: Some browser features or local resource loading might behave slightly differently compared to serving via a web server.*

2.  **Using a Local Web Server:**
    This is the recommended method for a more accurate preview.
    *   **Using Python (if installed):**
        ```bash
        # For Python 3
        python3 -m http.server
        # For Python 2
        python -m SimpleHTTPServer
        ```
    *   **Using Node.js (`http-server`):**
        If you have Node.js installed, you can install `http-server` globally:
        ```bash
        npm install -g http-server
        ```
        Then, run it from the project root directory:
        ```bash
        http-server
        ```
    After starting the server using any method, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` (or the address and port indicated by the server command).
